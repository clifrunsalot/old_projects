TO REBUILD THE CODE

1) In week1/conFusion, run these
  - sudo npm install -g gulp
  - sudo npm install -g bower
  - npm install
  - bower install
	- sudo npm install cordova ionic -g

2) Rename week1/ionic to week1/ionic_orig

3) Create the directory week1/ionic

4) cd into ionic and run

	- ionic  start conFusion sidemenu

5) copy the following:

	week1/ionic_orig/www/index.html ==>  week1/ionic/www/index.html
	week1/ionic_orig/www/js/* ==>  week1/ionic/www/js/*
	week1/ionic_orig/www/templates/* ==>  week1/ionic/www/templates/*


TO RUN THE WEBPAGES

1) In week1/json-server, run this to mock REST server to feed the data objects.

  > json-server --watch db.json

2) In week1/ionic/conFusion
  > ionic serve --lab

3) This will spawn the ionic cordova mobile webpages for iphone and android.
